                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>Gemsbok is the common name given to the largest and most well known of the 3 species of Oryx.
     Due to their horns being so lethal, Gemsbok have also been called the ‘Sabre Antelope’.
     Its name is actually derived from the German word for a male chamois, although they are not related.
     Gemsbok are distributed around deserts, scrublands and brushlands in South Western Africa.</p>
 <p>There are two types of Gemsbok, a northern and a southern variety.
     The only difference between them is that the northern variety have black fringes on
     their ears while the southern variety have longer horns and their ears are more rounded in shape. 
     Southern gemsbok are more abundant than the northern gemsbok. Gemsbok have also been introduced
     in Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>Gemsbok have a horse-like posture and gallop and have muscular necks and shoulders.
     They have a long tail with black flowing hair.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gemsboks at the grasslands or savannas and on flat or hilly country 
    in the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa .</p>
