                        <h3>GIRAFEE</h3>
     <p>Giraffe are highly social animals and live in herds of 15-20 female giraffe and some young males.
           Male calves will leave their mothers and the herd from around 15 months and join 
           bachelor herds of other young males. The female calves tend to stay with the same herd as
           their mothers but can leave after the age of around 18 months old, 
           and most often stay in the same areas as the family herd they grew up in.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>Most giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa,
     especially in reserves such as the Serengeti National Park and the Amboseli National Park.
     Some are also found in the reserves of Southern Africa.</p>
