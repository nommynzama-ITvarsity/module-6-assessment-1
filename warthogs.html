                        <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
     <p>There is no denying that warthogs are not the most aesthetically pleasing
          of Africa’s wildlife. Large, flat heads covered in ‘warts’, 
         four sharp tusks, sparse hair – they are not likely to win any beauty contests</p>
         <p>They do have some odd habits – entering burrows backwards, 
             trotting with erect tails, and bending their forelegs to graze
            but their undeniable charisma will leave a memorable mark on your safari. </p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>Warthogs live in Africa's southern Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia,
     in savanna woodland and grasslands</p>
